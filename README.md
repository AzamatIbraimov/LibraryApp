# Spring Boot "Library Management System"

## How to Run 

This application is packaged as a war which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the ```java -jar``` command.

* Clone this repository 
* Make sure you are using JDK 1.8 and Maven 3.x
* You can build the project and run the tests by running ```mvn clean package```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
```
        java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=test target/spring-boot-rest-example-0.5.0.war
or
        mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="spring.profiles.active=test"
```
* Check the stdout or boot_example.log file to make sure no exceptions are thrown

Once the application runs you should see something like this

```

```

## About the Service

The service is just a simple Library Management system REST service. It uses MySQL database to store the data. 
You can use this sample service to understand the conventions and configurations that allow you to create a DB-backed RESTful service. Once you understand and get comfortable with the sample app you can add your own services following the same patterns as the sample service.

# About Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an "opinionated" application bootstrapping framework that makes it easy to create new RESTful services (among other types of applications). It provides many of the usual Spring facilities that can be configured easily usually without any XML. In addition to easy set up of Spring Controllers, Spring Data, etc. Spring Boot comes with the Actuator module that gives the application the following endpoints helpful in monitoring and operating the service:
